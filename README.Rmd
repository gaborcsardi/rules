`rules` is a "`parsnip`-adjacent" packages with model definitions for different rule-based models, including:

 * cubist models that have discrete rule sets that contain linear models with an ensemble method similar to boosting
 * classification rules where a ruleset is derived from an initial tree fit
 * _rule-fit_ models that begin with rules extracted from a tree ensemble which are then added to a regularized linear or logistic regression. 

## Installation
