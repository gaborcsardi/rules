Rules extracted initial model converted set binary features. features added regularized regression model (along original columns). example: common use lasso model regularize model eliminate non-informative features. details can depend implementation, rules appear pruned simplified. tuning parameters model inherits parameter tree-based model well amount regularization used glmnet model. complexity rules determined allowed depth tree. example, using depth four means rule may four terms define . number rules primarily determined number boosting iterations. RuleFit, implemented xrf package, required data complete (.e, non-missing). original data set, body mass encoded integer xrf requires double, : Fitting model: get rules associated coefficients, tidy() method can used : Note units predictor scaled zero one. Looking rules, examples rules, : can simplified fewer conditions: Also, tidy() function can extract information use original predictors unit: single rule might represented multiple rows version data. results can also used compute rough estimate variable importance using absolute value coefficients:","code":"data_with_rules <-    data %>%    mutate(     rule_1 = ifelse(A <  a & B <  b, 0, 1),     rule_2 = ifelse(A <  a & B >= b, 0, 1),     rule_2 = ifelse(A >= a,          0, 1)   )  rule_fit_model <-    glmnet(x = data_with_rules %>% select(A, B, starts_with(\"rule_\") %>% as.matrix(),          y = data_with_rules$y,          alpha = 1) penguins <-    penguins %>%    mutate(body_mass_g = body_mass_g + 0.0) %>%    na.omit() rule_fit_spec <-    rule_fit(trees = 10, tree_depth = 5, penalty = 0.01) %>%    set_engine(\"xrf\") %>%   set_mode(\"regression\")   rule_fit_fit <-    rule_fit_spec %>%    fit(body_mass_g ~ ., data = penguins) rule_fit_fit #> parsnip model object #>  #> An eXtreme RuleFit model of 112 rules. #>  #> Original Formula: #>  #> body_mass_g ~ species + island + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + [truncated] rf_res <- tidy(rule_fit_fit) rf_res #> # A tibble: 110 × 3 #>    rule_id           rule                                         estimate #>    <chr>             <chr>                                           <dbl> #>  1 (Intercept)       ( TRUE )                                      5753.   #>  2 bill_depth_mm     ( bill_depth_mm )                              -15.9  #>  3 bill_length_mm    ( bill_length_mm )                               1.10 #>  4 flipper_length_mm ( flipper_length_mm )                           -7.67 #>  5 islandDream       ( island == 'Dream' )                          -29.2  #>  6 islandTorgersen   ( island == 'Torgersen' )                      -16.8  #>  7 r0_2              ( species == 'Gentoo' )                        472.   #>  8 r0_3              ( sex != 'male' ) & ( species != 'Gentoo' )    -78.8  #>  9 r1_2              ( flipper_length_mm >= 211.5 )                 219.   #> 10 r1_3              ( flipper_length_mm <  194.5 ) & ( flipper_…  -142.   #> # … with 100 more rows ( bill_depth_mm >= 14.1499996 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm <  227 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm <  228.5 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm >= 197.5 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm >= 224.5 )\" ( bill_depth_mm >= 14.1499996 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm <  227 ) &  ( flipper_length_mm >= 197.5 ) & rf_variable_res <- tidy(rule_fit_fit, unit = \"columns\") rf_variable_res #> # A tibble: 452 × 3 #>    rule_id term              estimate #>    <chr>   <chr>                <dbl> #>  1 r0_3    species             -78.8  #>  2 r0_2    species             472.   #>  3 r0_3    sex                 -78.8  #>  4 r1_3    flipper_length_mm  -142.   #>  5 r1_2    flipper_length_mm   219.   #>  6 r1_3    flipper_length_mm  -142.   #>  7 r2_7    flipper_length_mm     9.04 #>  8 r2_7    sex                   9.04 #>  9 r2_7    species               9.04 #> 10 r3_3    flipper_length_mm  -101.   #> # … with 442 more rows num_rules <- sum(grepl(\"^r[0-9]*_\", unique(rf_res$rule_id))) + 1  rf_variable_res %>%    dplyr::filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") %>%    group_by(term) %>%    summarize(effect = sum(abs(estimate)), .groups = \"drop\") %>%    ungroup() %>%    # normalize by number of possible occurrences   mutate(effect = effect / num_rules ) %>%    arrange(desc(effect)) #> # A tibble: 6 × 2 #>   term              effect #>   <chr>              <dbl> #> 1 flipper_length_mm 219.   #> 2 bill_depth_mm     175.   #> 3 bill_length_mm    175.   #> 4 species            69.5  #> 5 sex                52.0  #> 6 island              9.84"},{"path":"https://rules.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/cubist-and-rulefit.html","id":"references","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"What's the difference between Cubist and RuleFit?","text":"Quinlan R (1987). “Simplifying Decision Trees.” International Journal Man-Machine Studies, 27(3), 221-234.
